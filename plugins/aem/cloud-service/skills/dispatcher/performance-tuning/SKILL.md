# Dispatcher Performance Tuning (Cloud)

Improve cache efficiency, latency, and throughput for cloud deployments that use the Adobe Dispatcher Apache HTTP Server module and related HTTPD configuration.

## Variant Scope

- This skill is cloud-service-only.
- Scope remains Cloud-only after target project evidence is confirmed; missing/conflicting evidence requires focused confirmation, not a directory-based assumption.

## Runtime and Availability Preflight

Before workflows, edits, or commands, confirm target module/runtime from active dependencies, deployment configuration, and Dispatcher layout, not this directory or `AEM_DEPLOYMENT_MODE` alone.

- Cloud: primary `aem-sdk-api` plus Cloud target/defaults; `opt-in/USE_SOURCES_DIRECTLY` marks flexible mode, but legacy Cloud may lack it. AMS: primary `uber-jar`/6.5 version plus AMS target/layout such as `ams_default.vars` and tier farms. Shared config directories alone prove neither runtime; confirm actual LTS version/hosting.
- On a wrong-runtime mismatch, STOP; explicitly route to the companion runtime's Dispatcher plugin with no wrong-mode commands. For missing/conflicting evidence, ask focused confirmation of target runtime/module/source root; make no runtime-specific edits or commands until resolved.
- Discover actual Cloud MCP tools/prerequisites separately from mode. All linked workflows and checklists are conditional: allow bounded conceptual explanation/static source review without MCP; report each required tool-dependent check BLOCKED / NOT VERIFIED with its missing prerequisite, leaving items incomplete.
- Never fabricate evidence or substitute another runtime's tools. Separate static review, SDK file/baseline/startup checks, and live target evidence; no runtime/release sign-off from incomplete checks or production proof from local results. Core-7 signatures are repository contracts, not publicly verified Adobe SDK interfaces; inspect exposed schemas/installed help before execution.

## MCP Tool Contract

Use only these Dispatcher MCP tools:

- `validate`
- `lint`
- `sdk`
- `trace_request`
- `inspect_cache`
- `monitor_metrics`
- `tail_logs`

## Workflow

1. Capture baseline metrics and cache evidence.
2. Apply cloud guardrails (immutable/default includes, reserved probe paths, and CDN-vs-Dispatcher ownership) before proposing changes.
3. Prioritize low-risk/high-impact changes.
4. Apply minimal edits.
5. Verify with `validate`, `lint`, and `sdk`.
6. Compare before/after runtime evidence.

## Verification Scope Selection

Use shared references to select optimization evidence depth:

- [mode-specific-verification-matrix.md](./references/dispatcher-foundation/mode-specific-verification-matrix.md)
- [test-case-catalog.md](./references/dispatcher-foundation/test-case-catalog.md)

## Output Contract

Always return:

- baseline metrics snapshot
- prioritized optimization list with impact/risk
- changed files and intent
- executed checks + before/after evidence
- selected test IDs and outcomes
- rollback plan and open risks

## Guardrails

- Do not claim improvement without measurable comparison.
- Keep high-risk tuning opt-in unless user explicitly requests it.
- Keep cloud assumptions explicit for each recommendation batch.
- Route edge/WAF/CDN-only concerns to CDN layer guidance instead of Dispatcher config changes.
