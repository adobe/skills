# Changelog

This file starts at 0.14.0. Prior versions (0.3.0 – 0.13.1) are documented in
git history only (plus the branch-scoped notes in
`CHANGELOG-redesign-adobecom.md` and `CHANGELOG-delivery-media-fidelity.md`).

## 0.14.5 — Tessl quality pass, part 2 (rules-inline / rationale-out restructure)

The four remaining sub-80 SKILL.mds restructured under a strict contract:
every rule, gate, discipline, and refusal condition stays inline (tersened);
only rationale, historical narratives, worked examples, and flag-gated modal
flows move to reference files, each wired with an imperative READ gate at its
consumption point. Rule-preservation audited per skill (zero deletions;
deploy's #NN set verified by comm).

- deploy 892→475 (+5 refs: decode-disciplines, encode-contract, font-strategy,
  anti-patterns, runtime-bootstrap) · direct 1596→398 (+prep-mode, add-variant,
  mode-notes) · prototype 1486→1215 (+prep-mode, lessons — most conservative;
  design-critical core stays inline) · uplift 593→430 (+output-templates).
- Validated by A/B runs following the restructured docs as written: deploy
  docs-page conversion 41/41 QA green, full baseline match (+1 focus-ring bug
  caught that baseline missed); direct re-run structurally equivalent on every
  load-bearing field (mode, pins, 4 seed dims, 4 inversions, improvements
  F-ids, register, density).
- A/B-evidenced additions: § Page templates (Template: metadata → body
  <name>-template + template-vs-block specificity warning), harness-parity
  notes, hardened collectNodes (mixed text+inline cells), Mode A research
  sentence + craft in the roll list, dangling impeccable pointers
  (teach.md/load-context.mjs) softened for current impeccable versions,
  cross-refs to moved sections repaired.

## 0.14.4 — Tessl quality pass, part 1 (descriptions)

Description rewrites for the two skills whose tessl-review drag included
description criteria: `extract` (adds a "Use when…" clause + natural trigger
terms — analyze/reverse-engineer/capture design tokens — and a "Not for"
scraping disambiguation) and `prepare-migration` (plain-language framing of
the prep cascade + trigger phrases + "Not for" migrate/deploy
disambiguation). Body text untouched — zero behavioral surface; the
conciseness/progressive-disclosure restructuring of extract/deploy is a
separate follow-up with its own validation run.

## 0.14.3 — seventh-site validation harvest (stardust.style) + review fixes

Learnings L1–L9 from the final validation run (full pipeline on
stardust.style, hands-off) plus the PR-review findings, folded:

- **crawl.mjs:** trailing-slash forms kept verbatim with slash-insensitive
  dedupe + a guarded 404 slash-retry that records the resolved URL
  (`_crawl-log.json#crawl.slashRetries[]`); `reducedMotion: 'reduce'` on every
  context + an 800ms post-scroll settle (animated h1s were silently dropped);
  visible `<pre>` contents captured as `codeBlocks[]`; collision-safe slug
  assignment (query-variant / flattened-path pages no longer clobber one
  file); sitemap-index recursion (child-sitemap `.xml` locs no longer queued
  as pages); `page.close()` on every exit path via try/finally.
- **Specs:** playwright re-probe rule at the start of every rendering skill
  (`--no-save` installs are pruned by any later `npm i`); token-hygiene gate
  at the FIRST phase commit (master SKILL.md); partial-inventory broken-link
  carve-out reconciled across content-preservation / migration-procedure /
  template-and-module-rendering; cinematic sibling handling specced in
  migrate (assets carried, `cinematic-variant-not-consumed` recorded);
  key-facts-in-server-rendered-content ENCODE rule (#86) with the declaration
  site defined (`DESIGN.json.extensions.metadata.keyFacts[]`); stale
  "closed catalog / 5 weaknesses" references reconciled in the master skill,
  divergence-toolkit, and artifact-map; diff JOIN/SPLIT limitation documented
  (#87, code fix pending).
- **Versions realigned** across plugin.json / tile.json / marketplace.json /
  README / this file (the #230 drift class).

## 0.14.1 — six-site E2E hardening (round 1, folded into extract)

Released as part of the six-site validation cycle; the crawl.mjs items listed
under 0.14.2's last bullet were folded here first. Documented retroactively —
see git history (`4a61c83`) for the full diff.

## 0.14.2 — six-site E2E hardening (round 2)

Fixes folded from validating the pipeline end-to-end on six live sites
(virginatlantic, festool, hirslanden, theroadhome, 3m, sliccy), ranked by
cross-site frequency.

- **migrate no longer dead-ends on missing canon (blocking; 4 of 6 sites).**
  The documented `prototype → migrate → deploy` path never runs
  `prepare-migration`, so migrate arrived with no canon and hard-stopped.
  `migrate` § Setup now auto-bootstraps canon from the first approved
  prototype (the `prototype --prep` write-back, run on demand) when canon is
  absent and an approved prototype exists; it only stops when there is nothing
  to derive canon from. (`skills/migrate/SKILL.md`)
- **bootstrap-authorkit is transactional + refuses the drift-prone default
  (blocking; 2 sites).** Boilerplate removal now runs *after* the mandatory
  edits verify, so a drifted/incompatible source leaves the original runtime
  intact instead of bricking the repo; `author-kit@main` is refused unless
  `--ref <sha>`, `--from-sibling`, or `--allow-unpinned` is given.
  (`skills/deploy/scripts/bootstrap-authorkit.mjs`)
- **atomic delivery contract now asserts computed layout (silent-failure
  guard).** A `.plain.html` pass is not a layout pass — the AuthorKit
  `.<name>.block` scoping bug ships a stacked single-column page green. The
  contract's final gate is now a headless computed-style check (grid blocks
  must compute `display:grid`, blocks decorated, 0 pageerror) once per
  template. (`skills/deploy/SKILL.md`)
- **crawl.mjs, folded in 0.14.1 and confirmed by the runs:** five-field
  `_provenance` emission, apex→www origin adoption, Usercentrics shadow-DOM
  consent, `<video>`/`<iframe>` capture, and the playwright preflight
  (`--no-save --legacy-peer-deps`) + copy-to-project ESM-resolution guidance.

Backlog (single-site or lower-frequency) tracked in the consolidated E2E
learnings digest.

## 0.14.0 — Fable 5 refactor

### Design quality

- **Reference-grounded direction.** `direct` researches real-site references
  via the optional refero MCP (`skills/stardust/reference/reference-research.md`)
  before committing to a direction; the curated seed roll is demoted to the
  fallback when refero is absent.
- **Brand-adjacent refinement tier.** A directed middle ground between
  faithful reproduction and full re-direction, so "polish, don't reinvent"
  is a first-class target rather than an improvised compromise.
- **Opened catalogs.** The uplift/prototype candidate catalogs (what-if
  amplifications, motion registers) are no longer closed lists: the agent may
  extend them with evidence-gated entries justified from the captured brand
  surface.
- **Vision verification gates.** `extract` and `prototype` verify their own
  screenshots/renders with vision checks before a step may pass, catching
  blank captures, broken renders, and layout collapse early.

### New capabilities

- **`stardust:audit`** — new skill: a design + SEO + LLM-visibility audit of
  a site, producing a scored HTML report. Uses the marketing-skills
  `seo-audit` / `ai-seo` methodology when that plugin is installed and
  built-in heuristics otherwise.
- **Cross-site same-brand extraction.** `extract --brand-source` /
  `--design-source` capture brand and design evidence from a sibling property
  of the same brand, with automatic sibling discovery.
- **Hands-off production mode.** `skills/stardust/SKILL.md § Hands-off mode`
  runs the full migration chain without conversational gates, folding the
  previously external master migration prompt into the skills.
- **Run contracts.** A per-run learnings ledger plus a `stardust/status.jsonl`
  run-status contract, so long runs are observable and each run feeds the
  next.

### Fidelity

- **Runtime-contract detection** in deploy/rollout: probe what the target
  runtime actually serves instead of assuming the authored contract survived.
- **Atomic per-page delivery verify** — each page is verified as a unit
  immediately after delivery, not batched at the end.
- **Foundation-first gate** — global foundations (nav, footer, styles,
  indexes) must verify before page fan-out begins.
- **Link audit** across the delivered site.
- **Query-index resilience** — index delivery/verification no longer
  false-fails or silently drops rows on slow propagation.

### Performance

- **Parallelism contracts.** Concurrent agents coordinate through a
  state-machine merge-by-slug contract instead of last-writer-wins on
  `state.json`.
- **Parallel prototype variants** and **crawl concurrency** in `extract`.

### Fixed

- **Version/reference drift.** `plugin.json`, `tile.json`, and the README now
  carry one version, and the impeccable dependency is declared consistently
  as **hard** everywhere (tile.json previously listed it as a soft
  dependency).
