# Changelog

This file starts at 0.14.0. Prior versions (0.3.0 – 0.13.1) are documented in
git history only (plus the branch-scoped notes in
`CHANGELOG-redesign-adobecom.md` and `CHANGELOG-delivery-media-fidelity.md`).

## 0.14.0 — Fable 5 refactor

### Design quality

- **Reference-grounded direction.** `direct` researches real-site references
  via the optional refero MCP (`skills/stardust/reference/reference-research.md`)
  before committing to a direction; the curated seed roll is demoted to the
  fallback when refero is absent.
- **Brand-adjacent refinement tier.** A directed middle ground between
  faithful reproduction and full re-direction, so "polish, don't reinvent"
  is a first-class target rather than an improvised compromise.
- **Opened catalogs.** The uplift/prototype candidate catalogs (what-if
  amplifications, motion registers) are no longer closed lists: the agent may
  extend them with evidence-gated entries justified from the captured brand
  surface.
- **Vision verification gates.** `extract` and `prototype` verify their own
  screenshots/renders with vision checks before a step may pass, catching
  blank captures, broken renders, and layout collapse early.

### New capabilities

- **`stardust:audit`** — new skill: a design + SEO + LLM-visibility audit of
  a site, producing a scored HTML report. Uses the marketing-skills
  `seo-audit` / `ai-seo` methodology when that plugin is installed and
  built-in heuristics otherwise.
- **Cross-site same-brand extraction.** `extract --brand-source` /
  `--design-source` capture brand and design evidence from a sibling property
  of the same brand, with automatic sibling discovery.
- **Hands-off production mode.** `skills/stardust/SKILL.md § Hands-off mode`
  runs the full migration chain without conversational gates, folding the
  previously external master migration prompt into the skills.
- **Run contracts.** A per-run learnings ledger plus a `stardust/status.jsonl`
  run-status contract, so long runs are observable and each run feeds the
  next.

### Fidelity

- **Runtime-contract detection** in deploy/rollout: probe what the target
  runtime actually serves instead of assuming the authored contract survived.
- **Atomic per-page delivery verify** — each page is verified as a unit
  immediately after delivery, not batched at the end.
- **Foundation-first gate** — global foundations (nav, footer, styles,
  indexes) must verify before page fan-out begins.
- **Link audit** across the delivered site.
- **Query-index resilience** — index delivery/verification no longer
  false-fails or silently drops rows on slow propagation.

### Performance

- **Parallelism contracts.** Concurrent agents coordinate through a
  state-machine merge-by-slug contract instead of last-writer-wins on
  `state.json`.
- **Parallel prototype variants** and **crawl concurrency** in `extract`.

### Fixed

- **Version/reference drift.** `plugin.json`, `tile.json`, and the README now
  carry one version, and the impeccable dependency is declared consistently
  as **hard** everywhere (tile.json previously listed it as a soft
  dependency).
